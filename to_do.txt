2. How to add Governance into it?
3. How can we measure the impact of the ReACTs in real OSS Projects



Need to find different ways to show the graphs - DONE
Need to read some more articles and update the database

ICSE , FSE Conference 
Dec 8 

Shall I shoot fo the MSR Conference, which is on Dec 8. I think this will be very tight. but still I will look for the apex paper, will see how the apex is designed. This can really be great if I can publish. But I have already a lot of things to in the next weeks.



There is a tool, developed by a company. The tool can assess project data and can say about the overall healh of the project.

Now how can we coordinate with the company and incorporate ReACTs in their tool. And answer the following question:
Question: How can we look into a project and see what are the ReACTs, the project is already doing, and what are the things they are not doing.

The question can be better titled as ReACTs into the real action



Things to do:
Subgrouping each of the features. Like num_act_dev: This can be subgrouped, such as: Major contributors, Minor, New Joinees, Core Developers, etc.



Adding Dynamicity to ReACT Tool:
1. Search for ReACTs based on publication profile
while given specific year range, selecting publication types (Conference, Journal, Book, Pre-print), Publication Venues (for conference:ICSE, FSE, MSR), (for Journal: TOSEM, IEEE Software, etc)

2. Search for ReACTs based on specific set of features
Users will be able to select features, for which they want to see ReACTs

3. Making the tool work on general set of features.
